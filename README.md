# Atmega48V-PGA2310-preamp
pre-AMP with PGA2310 controlled by Atmega48V, also include IR control and audio channel switch(relay)

All of the code come from internet,I just modify and combine them together for personal use.Don't used for comercial usage.
My project is to design a Audio AMP with IR control and channel switch, then I could with Audio source from TV/PC/CD, and control volume. 
so I select 1602 as display panel to display Audio channel and volume dB value, and PGA2310 is suitable for digital volume control.

The source code could be compile with AVRstudio.
